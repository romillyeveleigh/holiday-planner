## Practical Travel Tips

### Visa (UK Citizens)
- **E-Visa:** Apply online before travel at [visa2egypt.gov.eg](https://visa2egypt.gov.eg) (~$25, valid 30 days)
- **Visa on Arrival:** Available at Cairo airport (~$25 cash USD/EUR/GBP)
- Passport must be valid 6+ months from entry date

---

### Currency & Money
- **Currency:** Egyptian Pound (EGP/LE) — ~63 EGP = £1 (check current rate)
- **Cards:** Visa/Mastercard widely accepted; **most tourist sites now card-only**
- **Cash:** Still needed for taxis, tips, markets, small vendors
- **ATMs:** Available in cities; withdraw EGP on arrival
- **Exchange:** Better rates in Egypt than UK; airport exchange OK for small amounts
- **Budget tip:** Set aside 10-15% of trip budget for tips

---

### Tipping (Baksheesh)
Tipping is essential in Egypt—many workers rely on it. Carry small notes (5, 10, 20, 50 EGP).

| Who | Amount |
|-----|--------|
| Hotel porter | 20-50 EGP per bag |
| Housekeeping | 20-50 EGP/night (leave in room) |
| Restaurant (even with service charge) | 5-10% cash to server |
| Tour guide (full day) | 200-500 EGP |
| Driver (full day) | 100-200 EGP |
| Felucca captain | 50-100 EGP |
| Bathroom attendant | 5-10 EGP |
| Temple guards/helpers | 10-20 EGP |
| Taxi (if no app) | Round up to nearest 10 EGP |

**Tip in Egyptian pounds** (foreign coins worthless to locals). "La shukran" = "No thank you" for unwanted help.

**Pack:**

### Avoiding Scams

| Scam | How to Avoid |
|------|--------------|
| **Taxi overcharging** | Use Uber/Careem apps; agree price before if street taxi |
| **Camel ride trap** | Agree TOTAL price (including getting off!) before mounting |
| **"Free" gifts** | Decline politely; nothing is free |
| **Fake guides** | Only use guides with official tourism badges |
| **Inflated prices** | Research typical costs; haggle is expected in markets |
| **"Closed" attraction** | Ignore anyone saying site is closed—check yourself |
| **Papyrus/perfume shops** | Taxis may take you to "cousin's shop"—decline firmly |

**Haggling tips:**
- Start at 30-50% of asking price, meet in middle
- Walk away if price doesn't suit—often brings it down
- Don't haggle unless genuinely interested
- Fixed-price shops exist (look for signs)
